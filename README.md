# Portfolio

I've created a stunning modern portfolio website for Yonathan Million using the latest 2025 web technologies. The site features beautiful animations powered by Framer Motion, a sleek dark theme with gradient accents, and responsive design that looks perfect on all devices. Key highlights include dynamic typing animations in the hero section, smooth scroll-triggered animations throughout, interactive project showcases, and animated skill progress bars. The entire site is built with React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for optimal performance and maintainability.
